Web pages are written in Rmarkdown. This is basically a text file that allows  you to include images and R code chunks. The main things you need to know to write a document are:

1. Use `#` to create headings. 

# This is my big heading ` write: # This is my big heading`
## This is my medium heading `write: ## This is my medium heading`
### This is my small heading `write: ### This is my small heading`

2. Useful markup

- I am a bullet point `write: - I am a bullet point`
- *I am in italics* `write: *I am in italics*`
- **I am in bold** `write: **I am in bold**`

3. Links

[Google](https://www.google.com) `write: [Google](https://www.google.com)`

Using this simple markup you can write most web pages. For images and embedding see the next pages.
